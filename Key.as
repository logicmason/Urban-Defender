/*This class get initialized in the Constructor of the Game class.This class manages basic key presses, user input.You can just use this class by calling: Key.isDown(Keyboard.LEFT) from other classes like in AS2.0.*/package {        import flash.display.Stage;    import flash.events.Event;    import flash.events.KeyboardEvent;    public class Key {                private static var initialized:Boolean = false;        private static var keysDown:Object = new Object();  // stores key codes of all keys pressed        public static function initialize(stage:Stage) {            if (!initialized) {                // assign listeners for key presses and deactivation of the player                stage.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN, keyPressed);                stage.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_UP, keyReleased);                stage.addEventListener(Event.DEACTIVATE, clearKeys);                                // mark initialization as true so redundant                // calls do not reassign the event handlers                initialized = true;            }        }        		        public static function isDown(keyCode:uint):Boolean 		{            return Boolean(keyCode in keysDown);        }        		        private static function keyPressed(event:KeyboardEvent):void {            keysDown[event.keyCode] = true;        }                private static function keyReleased(event:KeyboardEvent):void {            if (event.keyCode in keysDown) {                delete keysDown[event.keyCode];            }        }                private static function clearKeys(event:Event):void {            // clear all keys in keysDown since the player cannot detect keys being pressed or released when not focused            keysDown = new Object();        }    }}
