Urban-Defender
==============

This is the first flash game I wrote.  It's a side-scrolling space ship shooting game that started as a direct port to AS3 of the Kongregate.com tutorials.  I later added new power-ups, new bosses and wingmen.  The some of the music files in this repo haven't been added to the game yet.  Any that are added in any forks must be attributed to their authors.

You can see the game in action on my blog: http://logicmason.com/2010/a-simple-flash-game/
